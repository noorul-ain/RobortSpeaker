# RoboSpeaker

RoboSpeaker is a simple Python script that converts text input into speech using the 'say' command. Created by Noor, this script provides an easy way to experiment with text-to-speech functionality on macOS.

## Usage

1. Run the script.
2. Enter the text you want the robot to speak.
3. Type 'q' to exit, and the robot will say 'bye bye friend.'

## Dependencies

- macOS: The script uses the 'say' command available on macOS. Adjust for other platforms if needed.

## Security Considerations

- Be cautious with user input to prevent command injection.
